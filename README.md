# Mike Cooper's Portfolio Site

Welcome to the README for my portfolio site. If you're here, you likely wanted to dive a bit deeper into the *how* behind my site. That's aweseome and I appreciate your curiosity. 

This site was built using a couple of my new favorite technologies. Mainly I used the process of building this site to teach myself Gatsby. I dove pretty deep into the docs and learned a bunch. The biggest challenge I think was creating the blog section of this site. This involved learning how to leverage graphql and Gatsby's File System Route API to dynamically generate pages for the individual blog post pages.

I also did some pretty fun stuff with Sass like creating some custom animations using mixins. 

Feel free to poke around the code here and if you have questions or what to discuss anything please [reach out to me](mikescooper@icloud.com)!
