The Project I’ve been working on lately has been a really eye opening experience in a lot of ways. Working in a group I’m being exposed to all sorts of things I never have been before. When discussing what tech stack to use, I suggested using React for frontend and RoR for the backend of the application. Everyone was on board for React of course but I was the only one who had ever used RoR for anything. Everyone else in this group was mostly familiar with Node.js

This week, so as not to be left out I started from the basics teaching myself Node. Here’s what I learned so far:

Node.js is so popular because it essentially allows us to run JavaScript directly on out computers. This is cool because usually JavaScript lives in the browser exclusively. Theres a bunch of really neat computer science tricks happening under the hood but essentially, Node is a wrapper that translates Js into something that can be compiled down to C++ and ultimately understood by the machine. 

With regular javascript everything is tied to the global `window` object and basically all methods are chained off of that by default. In Node there is a similar concept of the global object that is assumed and has a variety of methods that can be chained off of it.

In my very early learning of the basics as well, I learned that one of the cool benefits if Node is being able to essentially perform CRUD actions on the file system with Js. 

I have plenty more to learn but just from the very basics I think I’m going to like Node a lot and from how popular it is I think it will be a super useful skill to have under my belt. Can’t wait to try it out on a real project soon.
